# samlapi_onelogin

Simple Python script to get temporary AWS CLI role creds via STS, using OneLogin as the SAML IdP. Based on the [samlapi_gsuite](https://github.com/maromatorio/samlapi_gsuite), which in turn was based on the [generic script provided by AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-implement-a-general-solution-for-federated-apicli-access-using-saml-2-0/).
